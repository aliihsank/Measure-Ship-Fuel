# Measure Ship Fuel
A mobile app that learns fuel tank's volume according to height measurements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Uses an API as a gateway to create, manage, save Machine Learning Models
- Takes some user measurements and creates a model according to that dataset.
- Then uses that model to give predicts about fuel volume according to tank height measurement

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*This project uses given API project as backend : https://github.com/aliihsank/Measure-Ship-Fuel-API
